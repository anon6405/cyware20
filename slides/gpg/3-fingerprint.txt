 FINGERPRINTS

- a short sequence of bytes used to identify a longer public key.
- can be used to verify the identity of a person

For example:

1. A publishes public key on the Internet
2. B wants to confirm if that pubkey is actually A's
3. B asks A for fingerprint
4. B compares fingerprint to pubkey

Exchanging and comparing values is much easier for short fingerprints
than long public keys.
